# AI-Powered-Cybersecurity-Threat-Detection-System-in-Automotive-Systems
AI-Powered Cybersecurity Threat Detection System in Automotive Systems( malicious CAN  detection), (still under development).

 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an **AI-powered cybersecurity threat detection system** for automotive systems. The system analyzes **Controller Area Network (CAN) data** in real time to detect **malicious activities**, such as **Denial-of-Service (DoS), Fuzzy, and Impersonation attacks**. When a potential threat is detected, the system triggers an alarm or takes preventive action.

## 🔍 Features
- 📡 **CAN Data Analysis** – Monitors real-time CAN data for cybersecurity threats.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Model** – Trained on datasets containing normal and attack scenarios.
- 🚀 **Real-Time Detection** – Identifies malicious activities as they occur.
- ⚠️ **Threat Response** – Triggers alerts or initiates protective measures.
- 📊 **Data Visualization** – Displays attack trends and anomaly detection results.

## 📂 Datasets Used
The project uses four datasets:
     the dataset is released by kea and chevrolet car company , the drive link for datasets: 
     https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10o4npkG60guvac6vVdZdq2mHt5KdwWWP?usp=sharing
1. **Attack-Free Dataset** – Normal automotive CAN data.
2. **DoS Attack Dataset** – Data with simulated Denial-of-Service attacks.
3. **Fuzzy Attack Dataset** – Data with unpredictable, random attack patterns.
4. **Impersonation Attack Dataset** – Data simulating unauthorized access attempts.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow / Scikit-learn
- **Database**: MySQL (if needed for logging detected threats)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Deployment**: Flask / FastAPI (for real-time detection API)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup





## 📜 Usage
- Feed the system with **CAN bus data**.
- The model will classify data as **normal or malicious**.
- If a threat is detected, the system triggers an **alert** or initiates a **defensive response**.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- **Integration with automotive security frameworks**
- **Deployment on embedded automotive systems**
- **Extended support for more attack types**
