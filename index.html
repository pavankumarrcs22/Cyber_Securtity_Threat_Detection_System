  <h1>AI-Powered Cybersecurity Threat Detection in Automotive Systems</h1>
  <p>
    This project focuses on detecting cyber threats in automotive systems using AI-based models. The system analyzes real-time CAN Bus data 
    and classifies it into different attack categories such as DoS, Fuzzy, and Impersonation. The trained model helps in identifying malicious 
    activities to enhance the security of modern automotive networks.
